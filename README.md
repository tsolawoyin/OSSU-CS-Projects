# OSSU Completed Projects

Welcome to my repository of completed projects from the Open Source Society University (OSSU) curriculum!

This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed as part of my studies in the OSSU Computer Science program. These projects span various domains of computer science and showcase the skills and knowledge I have acquired throughout the curriculum.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress through the OSSU curriculum, share my work with potential employers, collaborators, and the open-source community, and to help others who are on the same learning path.


### Structure

The repository is organized into folders of completed projects. Each project folder contains a README with details about the project, the objectives, and instructions on how to run the code.

### Credits

I would like to thank the OSSU community for providing an excellent curriculum and the numerous open-source resources that made these projects possible. For more information about OSSU, visit their [official GitHub page](github.com/ossu/computer-science).
