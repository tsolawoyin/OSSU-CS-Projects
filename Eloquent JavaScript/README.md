# A Platform Game

## Description 

This project is the third project in [Eloquent JavaScript]() which starts from chapter 16 and ends in chapter 17. It features a 2D world with walls, coins, lavas and a player which traverses the world. The player simply go about collecting coins while avoiding any form of lavas.

## Technology Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## What I learned

This project taught me how to represent characters as objects and how to render those objects using:
- DOM elements
- Canvas element

I faced particular challenges with rendering, as this was my first experience working with DOM and Canvas display rendering. Understanding screen coordinates, scroll events, and how `requestAnimationFrame()` works took some time.

Additionally, I gained more practice with JavaScript classes and wrote interesting algorithms, such as touch detection, collision detection, overlap detection, and state update algorithm.

## Features

The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. The game supports two display systems. `DOMDisplay()` and `CanvasDisplay()`.

I recommend you have some HTML, CSS, and **serious** programming skills down. Marijn briefly goes over the HTML and CSS parts in chapter 15 and 16 and I think this is enough to get th
